# The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: Leverage, Wealth, and Building Systems That Work

*By Vikash*

## Introduction

Naval Ravikant's synthesis of leverage, wealth creation, and happiness provided practical frameworks for building scalable systems. His emphasis on code, media, and capital as forms of leverage directly influenced how I structure my companies.

> "Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, the code, the money that works for you."

## The Three Forms of Leverage

Naval identifies three forms of leverage:

1. **Code** - Software that scales infinitely
2. **Media** - Content that reaches many
3. **Capital** - Money that works for you

Understanding these forms of leverage shaped how I structure ventures for long-term value creation.

## Wealth vs. Income

Wealth is about ownership, not income. This distinction is crucial for building systems that compound value over time. Ownership means building assets that work while you sleep.

## Specific Knowledge + Accountability + Leverage

Naval's formula for wealth creation: specific knowledge + accountability + leverage = wealth. This framework helps identify what to build and how to structure it for maximum impact.

## Key Insights

1. **Leverage comes from code, media, and capital**
2. **Wealth is about ownership, not income**
3. **Happiness is a skill that can be learned**
4. **Specific knowledge + accountability + leverage = wealth**

## How This Shaped My Work

Directly influenced my approach to building scalable technology companies. The focus on leverage and ownership shaped how I structure ventures for long-term value creation. This book provided practical frameworks for building systems that work while you sleep.
