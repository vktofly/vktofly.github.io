# Naval Ravikant: Leverage, Wealth, and Building Systems That Work

*By Vikash*

## Introduction

Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur, investor, and philosopher known for his synthesis of leverage, wealth creation, and happiness. His frameworks for building scalable systems directly influenced how I structure my companies.

## The Three Forms of Leverage

Naval identifies three forms of leverage:

1. **Code** - Software that scales infinitely
2. **Media** - Content that reaches many
3. **Capital** - Money that works for you

Understanding these forms of leverage shaped how I structure ventures for long-term value creation.

## Wealth vs. Income

Wealth is about ownership, not income. This distinction is crucial for building systems that compound value over time. Ownership means building assets that work while you sleep.

## The Formula for Wealth

Specific knowledge + accountability + leverage = wealth. This framework helps identify what to build and how to structure it for maximum impact.

## How This Shaped My Work

Reading "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" in 2021 directly influenced my approach to building scalable technology companies. The focus on leverage and ownership shaped how I structure ventures for long-term value creation.

His emphasis on specific knowledge and accountability aligns with my philosophy of building systems that compound.

## Key Ideas

- Leverage comes from code, media, and capital
- Wealth is about ownership, not income
- Happiness is a skill that can be learned
- Specific knowledge + accountability + leverage = wealth
- Build systems that work while you sleep
