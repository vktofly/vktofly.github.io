    "name": "David Deutsch",
    "category": "philosopher",
    "description": "Physicist and philosopher known for his work on quantum computation, constructor theory, and the theory of knowledge. His epistemology of \"better explanations\" fundamentally shaped my understanding of progress and knowledge creation.",
    "keyIdeas": [
      "Better explanations drive all progress",
      "Universal constructors can create anything physically possible",
      "The universe is comprehensible through better explanations",
      "Problems are inevitable but soluble",
      "Knowledge grows through explanation, not accumulation"
    ],
    "whyTheyMatter": "Deutsch's work provided the epistemological foundation for my Infinite Growth Principle. His concept of universal constructors directly influenced how I think about building systems—not just tools, but systems that create further systems. His emphasis on \"better explanations\" over \"more facts\" transformed my approach to learning, creation, and entrepreneurship.",
    "howTheyShapedYou": "Reading \"The Beginning of Infinity\" in 2015 was a paradigm shift. It showed me that knowledge compounds infinitely when we focus on creating better explanations. This directly influenced my approach to building 23+ companies—each one is an experiment in creating better explanations about how the world works. Deutsch's epistemology became the foundation for my view of entrepreneurship as epistemology in motion.",

    ],
    "whyTheyMatter": "Krishnamurti's emphasis on \"freedom from the known\" became central to my philosophy of innovation. You cannot create the future while being unconsciously shaped by the past. His teachings on awareness and consciousness directly influence how I approach problem-solving, design, and building systems.",
    "howTheyShapedYou": "Reading \"Freedom from the Known\" in 2018 challenged my deepest assumptions about freedom, knowledge, and thought itself. Every breakthrough in my work has come from questioning what I thought I knew. This book shaped my \"Freedom from the Known\" framework for designing AI systems and building companies. It taught me that true innovation requires seeing beyond inherited limitations.",
